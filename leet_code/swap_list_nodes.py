#  24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
# 
#  Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. 
#  You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)
# 

class ListNode:

    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next        

class Solution:

    def swap_list_nodes(self, head: ListNode):
        return
        


    

nodes = [ListNode(i) for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]]

print(print(nodes[0]))
