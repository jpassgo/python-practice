# https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/
#
# You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
# You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.
# DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
#
# [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
# 1 2
# 3 4
#
# [[3, 1],[4, 2]]
# 3 1
# 4 2
